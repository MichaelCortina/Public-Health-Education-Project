            &emsp;Quarantines are an effective strategy for containing viruses, but they require 
            everyone's cooperation. Most importantly, if you have the means get vaccinated! 
            Vaccinations are crucial in stopping the spread of a virus as they both 
            significantly reduce the symptoms and chance of death as well as reduce your 
            chance of getting infected. And if you are already vaccinated, make sure to get 
            a booster when possible as the effectiveness of a vaccination wanes over time 
            (CDC 2022). <br> <br>
            
            &emsp;Another important measure one can take to increase effectiveness is wearing masks. 
            Proper KN95 or stronger masks can reduce viral transmission by over 70%. If you need 
            to go into an indoor or crowded public space wearing a mask will greatly reduce the 
            risk of your spreading, or catching the disease (CDC 2020). <br> <br>
            
            &emsp;If you unfortunately encounter a situation where you come into contact with an infected 
            individual, make sure to get tested. Rapid testing and take-home kits are offered at 
            pharmacies across the country. If you test negative it is ok to resume life as normal, 
            but in the case of a positive test it is crucial to isolate for at least 5 days 
            (CDC and CDC 2022). In addition, make sure to inform all your recent contacts so they 
            too can test to see if they have contracted Covid. By self-isolating and contact tracing 
            the spread of a virus can be slowed significantly. <br> <br>
