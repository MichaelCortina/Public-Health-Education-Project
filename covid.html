        Quarantine In COVID19
    </h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;Quarantining was one of the first, and most effective disease prevention strategies 
        used at the start, and throughout the COVID19 pandemic. When the novel coronavirus 
        was first discovered in China, the quick action to quarantine the province of Wuhan, 
        and prevent foreign travel is estimated to have reduced foreign exported cases by 70% 
        to 77%. This lockdown additionally reduced case spread significantly from nearby 
        provinces within China. It is estimated that between the initial lockdown and 
        mid-February, travel bans prevented 73% of possible cases. This trend is continued in 
        Australia, whose early lockdown is estimated to have prevented 80% of the cases early 
        in the pandemic (Gr√©pin et al. 2021). <br> <br>
        
        &emsp;This is in stark contrast to America's disjointed pandemic response. By placing the 
        primary role of containing the virus on states instead of federal authority, response
        became split along party lines and inconsistent. This resulted in a lack of proper 
        containment in the states and counties which needed it most (Altman 2020). If the 
        federal government had taken greater control of the situation and imposed more strict
        lockdowns universally, significant numbers of cases and deaths could have been prevented.
