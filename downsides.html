        The Downsides of Quarantines
    </h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;While quarantining is a very strong pandemic prevention strategy, it does not 
        come without its downsides. In modern society, disease travels at a faster rate 
        than ever before. This can decrease the effectiveness of a lockdown if the disease 
        is able to spread rapidly before measures are taken (Taylor 2013). Additionally, 
        many countries and provinces do not have well defined and patrolled borders, making 
        it all the more difficult to impose a strict travel measures on the population 
        (Chuengsatiansup and Limsawart 2019). <br> <br>

        &emsp;Quarantine does not treat everyone equally. While many wealthier white-collar 
        workers during the COVID-19 pandemic were able to maintain their jobs and switch to 
        work from home, the same could not be said for many. The gig-economy, food and 
        hospitality, and other jobs reliant on in person interaction were hit especially 
        hard (Hegarty 2020). This compounds with the generally lower income of said workers, 
        leading to a significant economic and social crisis for a very large portion of the 
        workforce when implementing quarantine restrictions. <br> <br>

        &emsp;The economic impact of quarantine is not only on the individual level. Due to 
        globalism the world is more reliant and interconnected than ever before. As a result,
        when a country or region cuts itself off from the rest of the world during quarantine 
        this has an enormous impact on the economy leading to an increase in wealth disparity 
        (Ncube 2018). When in quarantine it becomes much harder for any economic growth to 
        occur, and the supply of goods can often not reach consumer demand. <br> <br>

        &emsp;The act of restricting freedoms taken for granted is also difficult, especially 
        for a democratic government (Taylor 2013, 243). Restricting the rights of the people in 
        quarantines for extended periods of time can lead to great social unrest. This can be 
        exemplified in the recent nationwide protests China's Zero Covid Policy. These protests 
        have caused China to back off on more intrusive measures such as forcing people into 
        state quarantine camps (BBC News 2022). A country in quarantine must maintain the 
        balance between protecting its populace from the disease, while allowing for personal 
        freedoms. Strict quarantines become even harder to support as other countries begin to 
        drop such measures. <br> <br>
