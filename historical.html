        The History of Quarantine
    </h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;Quarantines have been an effective strategy in disease prevention over the past centuries. 
        The quarantine first originated in medieval Venice in the 1370s. As the Black Death 
        rampaged across Europe, Venice sent incoming ships to wait 40 days on a nearby island if 
        it was suspected to contain the plague (Klibanoff 2020). This system used by Italian Cities 
        was later adopted by other European Countries (Tognotti 2013). <br> <br>
        &emsp;While the form and time period of the quarantine has changed the strategy has been repeated 
        to great effect in preventing disease ever since. Another successful example of historical quarantining was 
        Haiti's avoidance of the Cholera pandemic. While neighboring colonized islands were 
        ravaged by Cholera spread from imported soldiers and slaves Haiti managed to prevent any 
        major cholera outbreak throughout the 19th century. By implementing strict quarantine 
        policies on incoming ships, and disallowing access to ships from infected islands Haiti 
        prevented disease vectors from reaching the island (Jenson and Szabo 2011).
